simple loop without -fopenmp:
sum = 19999.749173
6,009s

simple loop with -fopenmp:
sum = 19999.749173
2,015s

result is still correct, behaves as expected, time is reduced but scaling is not linear
Still works after combining parallel and for pragma


The loops in other loop are not independent as they have the shared variable y
The result is no longer correct and changes every run because y introduces a data race
