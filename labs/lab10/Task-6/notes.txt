load balancing is achieved by incrementing the current number to be checked by the total number of threads. that way each thread has the same number of high and low numbers to check

M = 100000
N =   1 -> 5,198s
N =   2 -> 5,190s
N =   4 -> 2,596s
N =   8 -> 1,306s
N =  16 -> 0,662s
N =  32 -> 0,416s
N =  64 -> 0,276s
N = 128 -> 0,261s

scaling is pretty good, but I have no idea why it's shifted? N = 2 should speed up double while N = 64 shouldn't be faster than 32??
