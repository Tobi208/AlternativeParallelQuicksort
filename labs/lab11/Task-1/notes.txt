I predict that a is going to be unique for every thread where as b is shared
Since a is uninitialized, it can take any value that's currently in memory and is thus unpredictable

Making it firstprivate initializes a to the value it had in the root process, so it should be the same for every thread

Lastprivate allows us to "return" a value

All observations are as expected
