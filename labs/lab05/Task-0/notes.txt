Does a bunch of FP arithmentics, basically no system calls.

Same as regular code but the time spent sleeping doesnt count towards user time because it's not executing user code. Thread is probably handed off to a different process in between which is added to the real time.

Spends somewhat significant amount of time allocating memory which is a system call. Real time is sum of user arithmentics and system malloc.

Each thread spends 3 seconds executing user code which is summed up for all individual processes while the real time of the program is for all processes in parallel.
