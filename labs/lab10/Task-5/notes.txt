const long int NA = 700000000;
const long int NB = 100000000;
real time = 2,105s

const long int NA = 400000000;
const long int NB = 400000000;
real time = 1,268s

speedup is not quite 2.0 but still good since I'm timing the whole program

yes, the thread stops occupying cpu time once it finish its computations
