i is a long int because the max int is 2147483647 but i is 3000000000
for 32 threads, top shows 3200% cpu usage
for any number of threads <= 32, the run time stays approx. the same
using 64 instead of 32 threads however approx. doubles the wall time
that is because the cpu only has 32 threads so half of the jobs are run after the first half
