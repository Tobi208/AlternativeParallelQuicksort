I get zero speedup on vitsippa

tola9583@vitsippa:~/hpp/labs/lab6/Task-3$ ./restrict_test
transform_std tests took   0.327 wall seconds.
transform_opt tests took   0.328 wall seconds.

Getting a bit of speedup with N1 / 500, N2 * 500:

tola9583@vitsippa:~/hpp/labs/lab6/Task-3$ ./restrict_test
transform_std tests took   0.455 wall seconds.
transform_opt tests took   0.399 wall seconds.

So decreasing N1 definitely helps.
