I expect ModifyLow to be faster because a cache line is probably large enough for exactly 8 long ints. That means ModifyWith8Step is going to have 8 misses while ModifyLow is only going to have 1.

step8: 3,468s
low:   2,274s

Matches my expectations. However, as I read further below in the instructions, my assumption was wrong. Due to the loop, step8 should have the values in the cache too if the L1 cache was large enough.


step8:
n=100: 1,732s
n=50:  0,838s
n=30:  0,433s
n=20:  0,289s
n=10:  0,145s

low:
n=100: 1,135s
n=50:  0,540s
n=30:  0,140s
n=20:  0,094s
n=10:  0,040s

Nope, I cannot find a point where the code suddenly becomes a lot faster compared to step8. Seems to always be less efficient. And the time itself scales exectedly with n. Measurements done on vitsippa.
