yep, the loops are independent as each loop only accesses the arrays at their current index

n =  1: 15.87 
n =  2: 11.90
n =  4:  6.94
n =  8:  3.72
n = 16:  1.92
n = 32:  0.98

result stays correct, scaling is kinda weird

n = 4:
static  = 6.94
dynamic = 3.97
guided  = 3.97

dynamic and guided perform much better, could probably be optimized with chunk_size
