I went straight to transpose_x to save myself some time.

N=3000

blockSz=200
do_transpose_mod_standard 1 times for N=3000 took   0.843 wall seconds.
do_transpose_mod_optimized 1 times for N=3000 took   0.473 wall seconds.

blockSz=150
do_transpose_mod_standard 1 times for N=3000 took   0.848 wall seconds.
do_transpose_mod_optimized 1 times for N=3000 took   0.477 wall seconds.

blockSz=100
do_transpose_mod_standard 1 times for N=3000 took   0.803 wall seconds.
do_transpose_mod_optimized 1 times for N=3000 took   0.498 wall seconds.

blockSz=50
do_transpose_mod_standard 1 times for N=3000 took   0.808 wall seconds.
do_transpose_mod_optimized 1 times for N=3000 took   0.487 wall seconds.

blockSz=25
do_transpose_mod_standard 1 times for N=3000 took   0.831 wall seconds.
do_transpose_mod_optimized 1 times for N=3000 took   0.491 wall seconds.

Running on vitsippa, chaging the block size doesn't seem to have any effect? Or am I pregante?


Trying again for transpose (no x)

N=5000

blockSz=500

do_transpose_mod_optimized 1 times for N=5000 took   0.142 wall seconds.

Well, I get different values, but maybe I cannot find a trend.
